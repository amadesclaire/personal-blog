# personal-blog

I've included a compiled version of the app if you're on macOS. Just run

`./personal-blog`

If you're on windows or prefer to not run random executables follow the instructions below.

1. Ensure you have Deno installed on your system [(install deno)](https://deno.land/#installation)
2. In the root directory run `deno task dev`
3. Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
